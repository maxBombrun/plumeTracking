# PlumeTracking

Detects and parameterises volcanic plume in thermal videos.

Developped in Matlab.

## What it does

The program takes a list of thermal images (.mat format) as input and provides images of the segmentation of the mask of the plume as well as the contour overlayed on the original image.
It also extracts several parameters such as the height and the width of the plume through time.

The aim is to improve models for plume dynamics and automated monitoring in near-real time of volcanic eruptions.



## Usage

Modify the mainTrackPlume.m file to define the inputName variable, i.e., the absolute path of the data.
The format of the frames is supposed to be indexed:
- in numerical order, preferably with the same number of decimal. 
- in a clearly separated way from the name of the set by one of the following character: [',' ';' '_' '-' '.' ':'].

For example:
A dataset containing more than 100 frames should be named: 
exData_001.mat; exData_002.mat...

This algorithm requires two toolboxes:
- image_toolbox
- wavelet_toolbox
